* About Me
I am PhD graduate from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, with a research interest in wireless distributed systems. During my PhD, I have worked on distributed machine learning systems, broadcast networks for information retrieval and delivery, and wireless cache-aided networks, focusing on privacy and security.

After acquiring AIR 10 in GATE (EC) 2018, I joined IISc for an M.Tech in signal processing and upgraded to a PhD after one year. I have hands-on experience in image processing and computer vision projects. I also have a strong background in coding and information theory.
